*crawl_per_instance.py*

Code to backward crawl toots (user posts) from a Mastodon intance. Sample files generated by crawling https://pawoo.net can be found in pawoo.net/ folder. Please introduce ratelimits based on the requirements and I would highly recommend to join the discussions at https://discourse.joinmastodon.org/. 

Some of the field descriptions are as follows:
